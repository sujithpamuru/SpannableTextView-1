## Introduction
 
###### SpannableTextView is a custom `TextView` which lets you customize the styling of SpannableStyles of your text or statment via `Spannables`, but without the hassle of having to deal directly with Spannable themselves.

## Source
 
###### The code in this repository was inspired from [milaptank/SpannableTextView - v1.0.0](https://github.com/milaptank/SpannableTextView). We are very thankful to milaptank.

## Installation

In order to use the following library, add the following line to your **root** gradle file:

1.For using SpannableTextView module in sample app, include the source code and add the below dependencies in entry/build.gradle to generate hap/support.har.

```
dependencies{
    implementation fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar', '*.har'])
    implementation project(path: ':spannabletextview')
    testImplementation 'junit:junit:4.13'
}
```
2.For using SpannableTextView in separate application using har file, add the har file in the entry/libs folder and add the dependencies in entry/build.gradle file.

```
dependencies {
    implementation fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.har'])
    testCompile 'junit:junit:4.12'
}
```
3.For using SpannableTextView from a remote repository in separate application, add the below dependencies in entry/build.gradle file.

```
dependencies {
    implementation 'dev.applibgroup:spannabletextview:1.0.0'
    testImplementation 'junit:junit:4.13'
}
```

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

With the code below:

```
    Java
    stvMarksDown.addSlice(new SpannableStyles.Builder(this.getResourceManager()
                    .getElement(ResourceTable.String_stvMarksDown).getString())
                    .backgroundColor(RgbPalette.parse(this.getResourceManager()
                    .getElement(ResourceTable.Color_customized_burgundy).getString()))
                    .textColor(Color.WHITE.getValue())
                    .setCornerRadius(13)
                    .build());
            stvMarksDown.display();
            stvMarksDownText.addSlice(new SpannableStyles.Builder(this.getResourceManager()
                    .getElement(ResourceTable.String_stMrksDTxt).getString())
                    .textColor(RgbPalette.parse(this.getResourceManager()
                    .getElement(ResourceTable.Color_customized_darkblue).getString()))
                    .style(Font.BOLD)
                    .build());
            stvMarksDownText.display();
```

What kind of styles can I add?
--------
Right now you can customize the style of your text by using the following methods, which internally
get converted to the corresponding `spannableS`

| SpannableTextView         | Internal Span           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| textSize      | setTextSize() |
| textColor      | setTextColor()      |
| textSizeRelative | RelativeSizeSpan      |
| style | setTextFont()      |
| underline | setUnderline()      |
| strike | setStrikethrough()      |

What else can I do?
--------
Once you've created and displayed your SpannableTextView, you can modify the text contents of each
`SpannableStyles` individually. For example, if we want to change the `3.5/10` from the above example into
`6/10`, we could do the following:

```
    java
    {
      "name": "stvMarksDown",
      "value": " 6/10   "
    }
```
## Support & extension

Currently there is a limitation to set subscript,superscript,backgroundColor and ImageResource. So subscript,superscript,backgroundColor and ImageResource cannot be set from sample app to Spans.
